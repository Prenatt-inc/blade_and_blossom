 # My project here is a business website for a indivdual who works in the esthetician field. They have decided to trek out on their own and rent a space for themselves instead of working for a saloon. I thought this would be a great opportunity to help out a friend trying to be an entrepreneur as well as for myself if I were to go the route of doing basic websites for other indivudals in similar situations. 

 # CSS feautures - 3

 #  1. is a nav menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop sizes.  2. I use the :nth-child element to style my nav menu (can be found on line 14 and 19 of css styles)    3. I also use flexbox through out to adjuts for different screen sizes and orientations(landscape). The two media queries I have are for a ipad and iPhone 6/7/8 ios 11

 # Javascript feature is on my contact page. Its a a contact form that validates the fields and if all are correct, they will recieve a alert box thanking that specific indivdual for the message and then displaying their contact information when telling them that they will be contacted.
